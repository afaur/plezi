{"name":"AnoreXic","tagline":"A small, pure Ruby, web framework-server... so small - it's anorexic!","body":"# Anorexic - a r/evolution\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/anorexic.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/anorexic)\r\n[![Inline docs](http://inch-ci.org/github/boazsegev/anorexic.svg?branch=master)](http://inch-ci.org/github/boazsegev/anorexic)\r\n\r\nPeople who are serious about their frameworks, should make their own servers...\r\n\r\n(if to para-phrase \"People who are serious about their software, should make their own hardware.\")\r\n\r\n## About the Anorexic framework \\ server\r\n\r\nA thin, lightweight, barebones, mutli-threaded Ruby alternative to Rack/Rails/Sintra.\r\n\r\nAnorexic contains an object-oriented server, divided into parts that can be changed/updated and removed easily and dynamically. The Anorexic framework runs HTTP and WeSockets, but could as easily be extended to run SMTP, SPDY or any other Protocol (including custom made protocols).\r\n\r\nThis allows - much like Node.js - native WebSocket support (and, if you would like to write your own Protocol or Handler, native SMPT or any other custom protocol you might wish to implement).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'anorexic'\r\n```\r\nOr install it yourself as:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install anorexic\r\n\r\n## Creating an Anorexic Application\r\n\r\nto create a new barebones app using the Anorexic framework, run from terminal:\r\n\r\n    $ anorexic new appname\r\n\r\nThat's it, now you have a ready to use basic web server (with some demo code), just run it:\r\n\r\n    $ cd appname\r\n    $ ./appname.rb # ( or: anorexic s )\r\n\r\nnow go, in your browser, to: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)\r\n\r\nthe default first port for the app is 3000. you can set the first port to listen to by using the `-p ` option (make sure you have permissions for the requested port):\r\n\r\n    $ ./appname.rb -p 80\r\n\r\nyou now have a smart framework app that will happily eat any gem you feed it. it responds extra well to Haml, Sass and Coffee-Script, which you can enable in it's Gemfile.\r\n\r\n## Barebones Web Service\r\n\r\nthis example is basic, useless, but required for every doc out there...\r\n\r\n\"Hello World!\" in 3 lines - try it in irb (exit irb to start server):\r\n\r\n\t\trequire 'anorexic'\r\n\t\tlisten\r\n\t\troute(/.?/) { |req, res| res << \"Hello World!\" }\r\n\r\nAfter you exited irb, the Anorexic server started up. go to http://localhost:3000/ and see it run :)\r\n\r\n## Anorexic Routes\r\n\r\nAnorexic supports magic routes, in similar formats found in other systems, such as: `route \"/:required/(:optional)/(:optional_with_format){[\\\\d]*}\", Controler`.\r\n\r\nAnorexic assummes all simple string routes to be RESTful routes ( `\"/user\" == \"/user/(:id)\"` ).\r\n\r\n    require 'anorexic'\r\n    listen\r\n\r\n    # this route demos a route for listing/showing posts,\r\n    # with or without revision numbers or page-control....\r\n    # notice the single quotes (otherwise the '\\' would need to be escaped).\r\n    route '/post/(:id)/(:revision){[\\d]+\\.[\\d]+}/(:page_number)', Anorexic::StubRESTCtrl\r\n\r\nnow visit:\r\n\r\n* [http://localhost:3000/post/12/1.3/1](http://localhost:3000/post/12/1.3/1)\r\n* [http://localhost:3000/post/12/1](http://localhost:3000/post/12/1)\r\n\r\n**please see the `route` documentation for more information on routes**.\r\n\r\n## Anorexic Virtual Hosts\r\n\r\nAnorexic can be used to create virtual hosts for the same service:\r\n\r\n    require 'anorexic'\r\n    listen\r\n    host 'localhost', alias: 'localhost2'\r\n\r\n    shared_route '/people' do |req, res|\r\n        res << \"we are people - shared by all routes.\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    host\r\n\r\n    route('*') do |req, res|\r\n        res << \"this is a 'catch-all' host. you got here by putting in the IP adderess.\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    host 'localhost'\r\n\r\n    route('*') do |req, res|\r\n        res << \"this is localhost or localhost 2\"\r\n    end\r\n\r\nNow visit:\r\n\r\n* [http://127.0.0.1:3000/]( http://127.0.0.1:3000/ )\r\n* [http://localhost:3000/]( http://localhost:3000/ )\r\n* [http://127.0.0.1:3000/people]( http://127.0.0.1:3000/people )\r\n* [http://localhost:3000/people]( http://localhost:3000/people )\r\n\r\n## Anorexic Controller classes\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about the Anorexic is it's ability to take in any class as a controller class and route to the classes methods with special support for RESTful methods (`index`, `show`, `new`, `save`, `update`, `delete`, `before` and `after`) and for WebSockets (`pre_connect`, `on_connect`, `on_message`, `on_disconnect`, `broadcast`):\r\n\r\n\t\trequire 'anorexic'\r\n\r\n\t\tclass Controller\r\n\t\t\tdef index\r\n\t\t\t\t\"Hello World!\"\r\n\t\t\tend\r\n\t\tend\r\n\r\n\t\tlisten\r\n\t\troute '*' , Controller\r\n\r\nExcept for WebSockets, returning a String will automatically add the string to the response before sending the response - which makes for cleaner code. It's also possible to send the response as it is (by returning true).\r\n\r\nControllers can even be nested (order matters) or have advanced uses that are definitly worth exploring.\r\n\r\n**please read the demo code for Anorexic::StubRESTCtrl and Anorexic::StubWSCtrl to learn more.**\r\n\r\nHere's some food for thought - code similar to something actually used in the framework app:\r\n\r\n    require 'anorexic'\r\n\r\n    # this controller will re-write the request to extract data,\r\n    # and then it will fail, so that routing continues.\r\n    #\r\n    # this is here just for the demo.\r\n    #\r\n    class ReWriteController\r\n        # using the before filter and regular expressions to make some changes.\r\n        def before\r\n            # extract the fr and en locales.\r\n            result = request.path.match /^\\/(en|fr)($|\\/.*)/\r\n\r\n            if result\r\n                params[:locale] = result[1]\r\n                request.path = result[2]\r\n            end\r\n\r\n            # let the routing continue.\r\n            return false\r\n        end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    class Controller\r\n        def index\r\n            return \"Bonjour le monde!\" if params[:locale] == 'fr'\r\n            \"Hello World!\\n #{params}\"\r\n        end\r\n        def show\r\n            return \"Vous êtes à la recherche d' : #{params[:id]}\" if params[:locale] == 'fr'\r\n            \"You're looking for: #{params[:id]}\"\r\n        end\r\n        def debug\r\n            # binding.pry\r\n            # do you use pry for debuging?\r\n            # no? oh well, let's ignore this.\r\n            false\r\n        end\r\n        def delete\r\n            return \"Mon Dieu!
